          <p>
            Hello! My name is Alec Gomez, a 21 year old from Southern
            California. I was born in Valencia, California until I moved to San
            Francisco to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Cinema with a minor in
            Visual-Communication. My love for the film industry started in middle school where I participated in
            the campus's broadcast program, where I competed in the Studen Television Network Convention in both
            Anaheim, California and Nashville, Tennesse. I continued that love into highschool where I became the sole equipment manager 
            during my early years, and later head producer of the program. This drive for film and broadcast led me to San Francisco State where I 
            enrolled in the Cinema program. Along the way I picked up a Minor in Visual-Communication. Utalizing both passions has led me to different
            large scale productions, events, and discovering an affinity for audio-visual work in the Bay Area. Today, I manage one of the largest event spaces on 
            San Francisco State University campus, am signed on with an audio and DJ company called Dart, and work on 
            numerous projects and paid productions. None of this wouldn't have been possible without my loving mother who raised me,
            my father who always pushed me, and my sibllings who supported me throughout my endeavors. I have dedicated
            myself to always provide the best service I can while also working hard to improve my craft. My journey has just begun and I hope that you can be apart of it.
